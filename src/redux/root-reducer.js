/**
 * Reducers are supposed to return the initial state
 * when they are called with undefined as the first argument,
 * no matter the action.abs
 *
 * Now, whenever `LOG_OUT` fires, all reducers will be initialized anew.
 * They can also return something different than they did initially
 * if they want to because they can check `action.type` as well.
 *
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35622588/how-to-reset-the-state-of-a-redux-store
 *
 * If you need to keep a piece of the state and reset everything else,
 * capture the part of the state that you want to keep (in this example itâ€™s `articles`),
 * set `state` to be `articles` and return the new `state`.
 *
 * `articles` will have the previous values but every other part of state will receive `undefined`
 * and each reducer will return the initial default `INITIAL_STATE`.
 *
 * @example
 * const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
 *   if (action.type === 'RESET_APP') {
 *     const { articles } = state;
 *     state = { articles };
 *   }
 *
 *   return allReducers(state, action);
 * };
